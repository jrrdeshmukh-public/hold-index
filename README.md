### HODL Index FAQ

**1. What is the HODL Index?**
The HODL Index is a simulated investment portfolio that is designed to provide returns by holding a mix of cryptocurrencies, with periodic rebalancing based on price fluctuations and market volatility. The portfolio is initially equal-weighted among 5 assets: Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and Tether (USDT). Rebalancing is triggered when asset weights deviate by more than a defined threshold or when market volatility (measured by the VIX) exceeds a certain level.

**2. How does the HODL Index rebalance?**
The portfolio is rebalanced under two primary conditions:
   - If any asset's weight deviates by more than 5% from its target weight (20% per asset).
   - If the VIX (Volatility Index) exceeds 20. In such cases, the portfolio shifts to a high-volatility allocation, with 50% of the portfolio in USDT and the remaining 50% distributed equally among the other assets.

Rebalancing occurs on a daily basis, and portfolio weights are adjusted accordingly to either revert to equal weighting or maintain the high-volatility allocation during market stress.

**3. What assets are included in the HODL Index?**
The index includes the following assets:
   - Bitcoin (BTC)
   - Litecoin (LTC)
   - Ethereum (ETH)
   - Ripple (XRP)
   - Tether (USDT)

These assets are selected to provide a diversified exposure to both established cryptocurrencies (BTC, LTC, ETH, XRP) and a stablecoin (USDT).

**4. How is the portfolio value calculated?**
The portfolio value is calculated by summing the value of each asset held in the portfolio, based on their respective prices. The weights of each asset are determined by the initial investment and any rebalancing actions. The value is updated daily based on the asset prices.

**5. What happens when the VIX exceeds 20?**
When the VIX exceeds 20, it indicates high market volatility. In this case, the portfolio rebalances to a high-volatility allocation:
   - 50% of the portfolio is allocated to Tether (USDT), a stablecoin.
   - The remaining 50% is equally divided among Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP).

This allocation is designed to reduce exposure to riskier assets during periods of high volatility, providing a more stable portfolio in uncertain market conditions.

**6. How often is the portfolio rebalanced?**
The portfolio is rebalanced daily, based on the conditions outlined earlier (deviation in asset weight or VIX exceeding the threshold). Rebalancing dates are recorded for tracking and performance evaluation.

**7. What performance statistics are provided for the HODL Index?**
The following performance statistics are calculated for the HODL Index:
   - **CAGR (Annualized Return):** The compounded annual growth rate of the portfolio.
   - **Annualized Volatility:** A measure of the portfolio’s price fluctuations on an annualized basis.
   - **Sharpe Ratio:** A measure of the risk-adjusted return.
   - **Maximum Drawdown:** The largest peak-to-trough decline in portfolio value.

These metrics help evaluate the risk and return characteristics of the HODL Index over time.


**8. What is the VIX, and why is it important for the HODL Index?**
The VIX (Volatility Index) is a measure of market volatility and is often referred to as the "fear gauge" of the stock market. It represents the market’s expectations for future volatility. In the HODL Index, the VIX is used to adjust the portfolio allocation: when VIX exceeds a threshold (20), the portfolio shifts towards a more conservative, high-volatility allocation.


**9. How is the performance of the HODL Index evaluated?**
The performance is evaluated using standard investment metrics such as annualized return (CAGR), volatility, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown. These metrics help assess how well the portfolio has performed relative to its risk.
